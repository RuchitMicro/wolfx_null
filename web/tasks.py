    """
    Celery task to automatically upload scheduled social media posts.
    
    This task performs the following steps:
      1. Retrieves the current time using Django's timezone utilities.
      2. Queries the PostSchedule model for entries where the scheduled post timing
         (post_timing) is less than or equal to the current time and the post has not
         been processed (is_posted is False).
      3. For each due schedule, it simulates the upload process. In a real-world scenario,
         this is where you would integrate with the API of the corresponding social media
         platform (using the credentials stored in the SocialMedia model).
      4. After a successful "upload," the task marks the schedule as processed by setting
         is_posted to True and flags the associated post as published by updating its
         is_published field.
      5. Saves the updated states to the database.
    
    Note:
      - Replace the print statement with your actual API integration code.
      - Handle exceptions and retries as needed for production-level code.
